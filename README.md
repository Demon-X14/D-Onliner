### Step 3: Prepare the Tokens File
Rename the `RENAME THIS TO tokens.txt` file in the `config` directory to `tokens.txt`. This file is used to store your Discord tokens.

### Step 4: Run the Application
Start the application by running one of the following commands:
```
pnpm start
```

If you haven't provided any tokens yet, the application will prompt you to enter your token(s) separated by commas.
